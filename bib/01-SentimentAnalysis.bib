  abstract  = {We present a statistical parsing framework for sentence-level sentiment classification in this article. Unlike previous works that use syntactic parsing results for sentiment analysis, we develop a statistical parser to directly analyze the sentiment structure of a sentence. We show that complicated phenomena in sentiment analysis (e.g., negation, intensification, and contrast) can be handled the same way as simple and straightforward sentiment expressions in a unified and probabilistic way. We formulate the sentiment grammar upon Context-Free Grammars (CFGs), and provide a formal description of the sentiment parsing framework. We develop the parsing model to obtain possible sentiment parse trees for a sentence, from which the polarity model is proposed to derive the sentiment strength and polarity, and the ranking model is dedicated to selecting the best sentiment tree. We train the parser directly from examples of sentences annotated only with sentiment polarity labels but without any syntactic annotations or polarity annotations of constituents within sentences. Therefore we can obtain training data easily. In particular, we train a sentiment parser, s.parser, from a large amount of review sentences with users' ratings as rough sentiment polarity labels. Extensive experiments on existing benchmark data sets show significant improvements over baseline sentiment classification approaches.

We formalize the task as a learning problem on a bilingual word graph, in which the intra-language relations among the words in the same language and the inter-language relations among the words between different languages are properly represented. With the words in the English sentiment lexicon as seeds, we propose a bilingual word graph label propagation approach to induce sentiment polarities of the unlabeled words in the target language. Particularly, we show that both synonym and antonym word relations can be used to build the intra-language relation, and that the word alignment information derived from bilingual parallel sentences can be effectively leveraged to build the inter-language relation. The evaluation of Chinese sentiment lexicon learning shows that the proposed approach outperforms existing approaches in both precision and recall. Experiments conducted on the NTCIR data set further demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned sentiment lexicon in sentence-level sentiment classification.

  abstract  = {We present a lexicon-based approach to extracting sentiment from text. The Semantic Orientation CALculator (SO-CAL) uses dictionaries of words annotated with their semantic orientation (polarity and strength), and incorporates intensification and negation. SO-CAL is applied to the polarity classification task, the process of assigning a positive or negative label to a text that captures the text's opinion towards its main subject matter. We show that SO-CAL's performance is consistent across domains and in completely unseen data. Additionally, we describe the process of dictionary creation, and our use of Mechanical Turk to check dictionaries for consistency and reliability.

This article focuses on the problem of cross-lingual sentiment classification, which leverages only available English resources for Chinese sentiment classification. We first investigate several basic methods (including lexicon-based methods and corpus-based methods) for cross-lingual sentiment classification by simply leveraging machine translation services to eliminate the language gap, and then propose a bilingual co-training approach to make use of both the English view and the Chinese view based on additional unlabeled Chinese data. Experimental results on two test sets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can outperform basic methods and transductive methods.

  abstract  = {Many approaches to automatic sentiment analysis begin with a large lexicon of words marked with their prior polarity (also called semantic orientation). However, the contextual polarity of the phrase in which a particular instance of a word appears may be quite different from the word's prior polarity. Positive words are used in phrases expressing negative sentiments, or vice versa. Also, quite often words that are positive or negative out of context are neutral in context, meaning they are not even being used to express a sentiment. The goal of this work is to automatically distinguish between prior and contextual polarity, with a focus on understanding which features are important for this task. Because an important aspect of the problem is identifying when polar terms are being used in neutral contexts, features for distinguishing between neutral and polar instances are evaluated, as well as features for distinguishing between positive and negative contextual polarity. The evaluation includes assessing the performance of features across multiple machine learning algorithms. For all learning algorithms except one, the combination of all features together gives the best performance. Another facet of the evaluation considers how the presence of neutral instances affects the performance of features for distinguishing between positive and negative polarity. These experiments show that the presence of neutral instances greatly degrades the performance of these features, and that perhaps the best way to improve performance across all polarity classes is to improve the system's ability to identify when an instance is neutral.
